Getting Started with Create React App
This projectâ€™s frontend was bootstrapped with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Below are the available scripts and additional details.

Available Scripts
In the frontend directory, you can run:

- npm start
  Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it. The page reloads on changes, and lint errors appear in the console.

- npm test
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests for more info.

- npm run build
  Builds the app for production to the build folder, optimized and minified with hashed filenames. See https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment for more.

- npm run eject
  Note: This is a one-way operation! Removes the single build dependency, copying all config files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) for full control. Use with caution.
